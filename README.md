# Movie-to-Movie

This app compares actor resumes movie and tv listings, and returns the intersecting results as a list. 

This is my first app created in iOS 9, and uses themoviedb.org as the data source. 

My initial intent was to submit it to the app store, but after further research, there is an already an app that does exactly this. Unless I can think of additional benefits or features, it shall stay here and I will work on UI & UX.
